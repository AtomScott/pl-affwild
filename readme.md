## Visual-audio emotion learning

### Things to consider

- Which MutiModal learning technique is better?
    - Deep-CCA - Maximise the canonical correlation angles between different modalities. 
    - Cross-modal distillation - 

I think it may be best to compare both.

### What model architecture should be used?

I don't have enough time to recreate a perfect model so a the models will have to be patchy. This could be improved in future work.



#### Visual-emotion classification Model

A facial feature extractor + recurrent neural network.

#### Audio-emotion classification Model

MFCC + CNN??
